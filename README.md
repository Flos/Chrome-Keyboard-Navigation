# Keyboard Navigation Extension for Chrome
## Navigate website using the left and right keys

This extension binds the left and right keys to navigate true tabbable items.
The escape key closes the tab or if the last tab is closed it closes the window.

Webpages can be "optimized" for keyboard navigation by implementing the optimize() function.
