# Keyboard Navigation Extension for Chrome
## Navigate website using the left and right keys

This extension tries to find the next/previous URLs on a page and just binds the left and right keys to go to those URLs.

This is my first extension, so it may not be written very well!


You can find the extension on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/previous-and-next-page-ke/bgddcngmfadknajipncoemekkikibfhg).
